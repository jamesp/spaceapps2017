## NASA spaceapps hackathon 2017

A project in the "Icy Polar Opposites" category (https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/planetary-blues/icy-polar-opposites/details).

We aimed to produce a visualisation of polar sea ice that demonstrates the changes in time.  It should be an interactive web-based tool that gives users a tactile approach to exploring the data.

See the presentation file for further details and `d3globe` for proof-of-concept.  The ipython notebooks contain code used to take data from stereographic polar satellite samples (http://nsidc.org/data/G02172) and project sea ice extent contours onto a lat-long geodesic.
